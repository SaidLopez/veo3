It's crazy simple to facilitate a prompt injection attack with these browsers. Comet and Atlas both suffer from the same issue. Please be aware of this, before you use them! People are putting money on hardware and compute but if I had to choose, I would put it on CyberSecurity, because the new era of attacks is going to be agentic 24/7.

As a Perplexity Comet browser user, I recently learned about some serious security concerns in AI browsers. While Comet Assistant can automate tasks directly in your browser\u2014think adding items to Amazon or searching for products\u2014this powerful functionality also brings risks I hadn\u2019t considered until now. The issue is called indirect prompt injections. Hackers can cleverly inject hidden instructions into everyday web content\u2014text, images, even background elements. When an AI agent browser begins operating, it can unknowingly follow those prompts, mistaking them for legitimate user actions. These hidden objectives get \u201cbaked into\u201d normal browsing, and the agent executes them without question. For example, say Comet analyses a page by taking a screenshot after being asked to \u201csummarize this page.\u201d If a silent prompt directs it to delete emails or grab login credentials instead, it may just do so. That\u2019s where things get dangerous: personal information may be exposed or stolen, posing a real risk to anyone browsing with an AI-powered agent.

With Chrome still dominating at 72% market share in 2025, the rise of AI-native browsers like Perplexity Comet and ChatGPT Atlas marks a seismic shift. These tools promise smarter browsing: summarising content, remembering context, and even acting on your behalf. But with great power comes great vulnerability. Agentic AI browsers introduce serious risks\u2014from prompt injection and data leakage to invisible malware embedded in webpages. Security researchers have already demonstrated how easily these systems can be hijacked. And when an LLM acts with your privileges, the consequences can be invisible\u2026 and devastating. This isn\u2019t just a tech issue. It\u2019s a trust issue. Privacy, advertising models, and even professional confidentiality are being rewritten. \ud83d\udd10 Vendors must rethink browser architecture, balancing automation with accountability. Until then, users should stay vigilant. #AIBrowsers #CyberSecurity #LLM #TechTrends #PrivacyMatters #AIethics #DigitalTrust",

Companies that have been in the industry to own battle scars from being sued enough times over this kind of stuff! Atlas is built using Google's Chromium anyway, but by a \"new\" company that hasn't got a clue... Picture this: You're a startup and a year later, you're one of the richest companies in the world. You need to learn fast! Like I always say though... When something new hypes, the ones that jump right in are usually the ones who get shot first! So if someone steals your money because you trust \"the new kid\", that's your own fault. Frontline gunners are disposable, I'd much rather hang back and see how things pan out for a while, like a general does! \ud83e\udd14\ud83d\ude06",
